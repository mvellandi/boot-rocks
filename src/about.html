        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Boot Rocks is an independent review of Boot.dev, a unique programming
          education platform that combines game-like elements with practical
          learning. Our goal is to help potential students understand what makes
          Boot.dev special and why it might be the right choice for their
          programming journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe in transparent, honest reviews that focus on the actual
          learning experience rather than marketing hype. Our review is based on
          hands-on experience with the platform and a deep understanding of what
          makes for effective programming education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced developer looking
          to learn new skills, we hope our review helps you make an informed
          decision about your programming education.
