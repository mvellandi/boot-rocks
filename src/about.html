        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          This is an independent review of <a href="">Boot.dev</a>, a unique programming
          education platform that combines game-like elements with practical
          learning. I am <a href="">Mario Vellandi</a>, a marketing engineer who believes online education should be interactive and fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why all the effort to make the video and website? Frankly, I love their platform and would like to help upskill more people around the world. The Boot business model and pricing is similar enough to a social entrepreneurship that in the long-term can:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Radically demystify software development and logistics</li>
            <li>Reach far more people than universities or bootcamps</li>
            <li>Be far more effective than video courses alone</li>
          </ol>
           <p>They and their teachers can impact <strong>far more peoples lives</strong> than universities, bootcamps, and video</p>
        </p>
        <p>Secondly, I wanted to refresh my video production skills after a 15-year break.</p>
        <p>
          Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced developer looking
          to learn new skills, we hope our review helps you make an informed
          decision about your programming education.
