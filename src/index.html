          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Hey, Mario here, and I just want to tell you about this fun game
            that teaches programming. It's called
            <a href="" class="link">Boot.Dev</a>, and it's not some childish
            thing where you move blocks around the screen nor fall asleep
            watching videos, but rather interactive exercises with both
            practical basics and some advanced courses. Now, they're not paying
            me to say this, nor do I have a discount code. I just love their
            mission and want to help them grow. Though I can already code in a
            few languages, I tried them out in November and quickly bought a
            membership. Because it's fun! And here are eight reasons why they
            rock.<br />

          <h2>Complete Trade School</h2>
          <p>
            It's a complete trade school with a roadmap for any skill level. It
            covers both theory and applied computer science using practical
            in-demand languages. People can dive into learning the basics with
            Python, or jump ahead to over 30 courses covering things like Go,
            SQL, Docker, and Kubernetes. Creating well-rounded developers is
            their goal. Like a woodworking class, they keep students challenged
            with interactive exercises and projects that apply learning by
            doing. With a helpful community and a cute AI wizard bear that'll
            give you advice if you feed him salmon.<br />

            It truly is. Especially when compared to a university or bootcamp.
            Or scattered books and video courses without any interactivity and
            no accountability. All their courses are free to read and watch,
            with reasonably-priced memberships for the full experience. They got
            a YouTube channel and podcast that isn't shitty teaser marketing,
            but rather full courses, short explainers, and interviews with
            diverse engineers.<br />

          <p>
            If learning isn't fun, people will zone out or lose motivation.
            Their game-like experience is not a gimmicky add-on, but rather
            purposely woven in. The mechanics and achievements keep people
            active, and the fantasy aspect with Boots the bear and game items
            like potions, armor, and frozen flames make it memorable.
            Importantly, this does not hold people back who just want to learn.
            As the founder once pointed out:
          </p>
          <p style="padding-left: 30px; color: #ffcc6d">
            <i>
              The game system has been a constant, ship a feature that sounds
              reasonable. Watch how people actually use it, and then adjust it
              to encourage good learning habits as opposed to bad ones.</i

          </p>
          <p>
            They sprinkle humor here and there to lighten things up, like
            pop-culture Easter eggs in code examples. Or making fun at popular
            developer opinions while giving practical advice.<br />

            Not only are they experienced developers who teach with clarity and
            a steady pace, they apply the beginner's mindset and guide you
            through a course combining first principles in clear direction. You
            can tell their love for the topics are genuine because when they
            happen to be on camera, it never feels like a pretentious script.
            They naturally adjust their tone to be excited or serious and make
            the material come alive. We can all remember a handful of school
            teachers that made class entertaining or interesting. This is
            paramount for online education where distraction is just a click or
            tap away.<br />

            Tech is inherently abstract. You gotta admit it! There's no easy way
            to describe the call stack or algorithmic complexity. To this end,
            their courses and explainer videos have many helpful animations and
            diagrams, which most other learning resources don't. They also use
            plenty of metaphors, memes, and pop culture references that help
            make concepts stick. When visuals are combined with jokes and
            analogies, they explain concepts so much better than words can
            alone.<br />

            They strive to help students make steady progress through course
            design, achievements, and challenges. With a periodic boss fight
            where every player gets bonus XP. And to keep the learning blades
            sharp, they use Kaizen. Which for anyone watching who isn't a
            quality operations nerd like me, just means they constantly make
            little updates to their courses. Matching what great teachers do in
            real life.

          <p>
            While their tactics are inspired from gaming, ultimately, it's about
            keeping players in what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called 🌊
            <i>flow states</i> 🌊, or in academic circles, the zone of proximal
            development. All this means is that courses and lessons are just the
            right length, and assignments are just difficult enough so people
            don't get bored or anxious. Any gamer can agree on why this matters!
            I wouldn't want my lessons to be as easy as Animal Crossing, as long
            as Final Fantasy, nor sadistically punishing like Dark Souls.

            Second, they don't give away the answers. You gotta earn those
            points and items, buddy. If someone's having trouble, they encourage
            you to look up documentation, feed Boots a Salmon, or post a
            community question. It's about leaning into the uncomfortable,
            because that's what real-world development is so often like.<br />

            They have diverse, well-organized conversation channels and a cool
            player profile integration with the boot platform. Onboarding is
            straightforward, the rules are clear, and members are rewarded for
            being helpful. Trust me, I see this often where people go out of
            their way to answer questions or be encouraging when someone is
            confused or nervous. When you see for yourself how members come from
            all walks of life, with various skill levels from around the world,
            you quickly realize the goal is not teaching newbies to code, but
            helping every member to level up together.<br />

            particularly love is the human voice that casually talks about why
            changes were made and how they help students stay active and
            continue learning. Second, their podcast puts audience needs first
            and isn't an overbearing talk radio show. After guests have spoken
            for a bit, the host repeats what was understood so far and asks if
            it's correct. All this is about active listening and looking out for
